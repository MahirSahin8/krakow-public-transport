## INTRODUCTION
Krakow’s public transport network combines electric trams and buses operated 
by ZTP Kraków. Trams provide frequent, low-emission service along the main 
corridors, while buses connect neighborhoods and the suburbs that trams do 
not reach. Tickets can be purchased from vending machines, mobile apps, or 
drivers, and time-based options allow easy transfers. The system is known 
for reliability and coverage, which makes it friendly for students, 
commuters, and visitors.

In this project we represent the same topic across three common data 
formats: **CSV**, **XML**, and **JSON**. CSV is ideal for tabular data and 
opens directly in Excel/Numbers. XML makes hierarchy explicit with nested 
tags and can add context via attributes. JSON is the de-facto standard of 
modern web APIs, allowing arrays and nested objects to model richer 
structures. Seeing all three side by side clarifies their trade-offs.

Our workflow mirrors real teamwork with Git. Each task is developed on a 
separate **branch**, changes are **committed**, merged into **main**, and 
pushed to GitHub. This preserves history, isolates work, and minimizes 
conflicts. During the test, the expectation is to recreate this flow: build 
the required folders, create and fill the files in correct formats, and 
deliver the repository link, the last commit ID, and a ZIP archive.
